## [RStudio: A single home or R and Python](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-a-single-home-for-r-and-python/)

The goal of this meetup is to help you to use Python from RStudio.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who wants to use Python from RStudio.

## Why is this important?

Many Data Science teams today are bilingual, leveraging both R and
Python in their work. Typically, each language is used from a different
IDE but switching IDE is painful, and many of us at 2DII are already
familiar with RStudio. We would like RStudio to be the single home for
both R and Python.

## Syllabus

-   From RStudio, run complex Python code in .Rmd and .py files.
